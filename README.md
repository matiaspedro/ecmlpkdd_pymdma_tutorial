# IbPPRIA - pyMDMA Tutorial (Tabular Data)

This part of the session will focus on assessing the quality of some tabular benchmark datasets, as well as the quality of the synthetic data generated by the model.

The valuation will be performed with a set of *input validation* and *synthesis validation* metrics from pyMDMA [1]. 
We have 3 open-access datasets from UCI, commonly used in tabular data benchmark tasks.

In the first part we will be looking into the quality of the real dataset. Next, we will focus on the synthetic data generated by the model and will assess its quality.

## Preparation

Create a python virtual environment and install the requirements using the following commands:
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate # or .venv/Scripts/activate for windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Runing the notebooks
It is recommended you run the notebooks in your IDE of preference (VSCode, PyCharm, etc..).

If you wish to run on a JupyterLab notebook you need to setup the kernel with:

```bash
ipython kernel install --user --name=venv
```

And then run the notebook server with:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
